        Ever since Homer wrote <em class="quote">The Odyssey</em>, it has been on the lips of bards and the minds of men. It and its twin epic <em class="quote">The Iliad</em> are two of the greatest works of literature ever committed to the page. In these two poems, Homer gives the Western world a way to talk about itself, its struggles, its longings.</p>

        Homer laid the foundations of literature by speaking to the depths of the human condition. Before it is read from a book or recited on stage, story of Odysseus has already begun to play itself out in the life of every person. Who hasn't felt like a king deposed, adrift, wanting to go home? Who hasn't struggled with capricious gods, treacherous companions, or the harsh necessity of nature? <em class="quote">The Odyssey</em> tells a sobering and familiar tale: no matter how victorious we may have been in our fight, our trails are not yet over.

        Throughout the centuries <em class="quote">The Odyssey</em> has inspired countless translations and commentaries. Scholarship abounds for this poem. While the interface may be robust, the aesthetic is often lacking:</p>

        <em class="quote">What translation are you using?</em></a>
      <div class="q" id="q-1">Currently I am using the A. T. Murray translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> (1919). It is a prose translation which is a bit laborious, but it is also one of the best translations in the public domain. Mostly I wanted a public translation whose syntax roughly matched the Greek versification and didn't call Odysseus "Ulysses." Murray's translation also has strong scholarly support. It was published by Harvard for their Loeb Classic Series and still remains in print. It's also used by <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/"><u>The Perseus Project</u></a>.</div>

      <a class="eng-v" href="javascript:toggleDiv('q-2');" ALIGN="CENTER">
        <em class="quote">How many books are done right now?</em></a>
      <div class="q" id="q-2">As this is the initial build-out of the site, right now Book I (Βίβλος Α) has its first 62 verses entered, and the first stanza of Book II is entered as well. As I'm currently using Murray's prose translation, I have to manually put in the verse breaks to roughly match the Greek versification. It takes time (especially when you're also designing and building the site), but now with the initial build-out done, I can chug away at verses.</div>

      <a class="eng-v" href="javascript:toggleDiv('q-3');" ALIGN="CENTER">
        <em class="quote">Are you working on any other works right now?</em></a>
      <div class="q" id="q-3">My plan is to work like Western literature: get Homer right, and then go from there. Though I do have a few more classical and medieval works in mind to add to this digital library I'm building...</div>

      <a class="eng-v" href="javascript:toggleDiv('q-4');" ALIGN="CENTER">
        <em class="quote">What do you do? Are you a teacher?</em></a>
      <div class="q" id="q-4">If you're wondering why I know Greek: I originally studied theology in college and I'm also Eastern Orthodox. This fluency with Greek came in handy during my freelance career, as I've edited several textbooks and monographs on Biblical Greek. I also taught for a few years at a pair of classical schools here in Grand Rapids, MI. Currently, I do a lot of illustration, design, and web development work. If you need anything in those areas, feel free to <a href="mailto:samuel.w.granger@gmail.com?Subject=Odyssey.io"><u>Email Me</u></a>. I'm always looking for new work.</div>
